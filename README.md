# Youtube_dislike_dataset_analysis

Hello there,
 This is my recent Python project on Exploratory Data Analysis in the domain of social media.
âœ¨ It is a Graded Project as part of the Python programming, I embarked on an exhilarating journey into the realm of YouTube data to unravel intriguing insights about video dislikes.

This project encompassed a multi-faceted approach:
ðŸŽ¯ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing -->Tackling the raw data, ensuring its accuracy, and whipping it into shape for analysis.
ðŸŽ¯ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python --> Leveraging the power of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I delved deep into the data. These tools became my trusty companions as I navigated through the dataset's intricacies.
ðŸŽ¯ Unveiling Trends and Patterns--> Armed with Python's analytical techniques, I deciphered trends, uncovered patterns, and unearthed correlations that held the key to understanding dislikes in the YouTube universe.

ðŸ’¡ This project was more than just code â€“ it was an eye-opening experience that provided valuable insights into the complex world of user engagement on YouTube. By peeling back the layers, I gained a profound understanding of the factors that influence video dislikes.
